  @doc """
  Takes a job suite with job run times, returns a map representing the
  statistics of the job suite as follows:

    * average       - average run time of the job in Î¼s (the lower the better)
    * ips           - iterations per second, how often can the given function be
      executed within one second (the higher the better)
    * std_dev       - standard deviation, a measurement how much results vary
      (the higher the more the results vary)
    * std_dev_ratio - standard deviation expressed as how much it is relative to
      the average
    * std_dev_ips   - the absolute standard deviation of iterations per second
      (= ips * std_dev_ratio)
    * median        - when all measured times are sorted, this is the middle
      value (or average of the two middle values when the number of times is
      even). More stable than the average and somewhat more likely to be a
      typical you see.
    * minimum       - the smallest (fastest) run time measured for the job
    * maximum       - the biggest (slowest) run time measured for the job
    * sample_size   - the number of run time measurements taken

  ## Parameters

  * `suite` - the job suite represented as a map after running the measurements,
    required to have the run_times available under the `run_times` key
