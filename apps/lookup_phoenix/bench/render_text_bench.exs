This is the first entry in my digital diary.  We will see how the experiment goes. How consistent can I be? Does the technology (LookupNote.io, written in Elixir), really work for this?

Still jet-lagged from trip to India.  It's 4:15am and I've read one article on the latest Donald Trump outrage, and am now reading once again about the http://www.adamwaselnuk.com/elm/2016/05/27/understanding-the-elm-type-system.html[Elm type system] -- haven't put any work into my Elm Noteshare client for a long time, but was able to remember how to run it. (Yay!).  The backend, written in Ruby, has been chugging away reliably now for a year with almost no changes (ditto Yay!).

_Note to myself:_ please study http://www.adamwaselnuk.com/elm/2016/05/27/understanding-the-elm-type-system.html[Elm type system] .

I sometimes (now more often than before) have doubts about the wisdom of my software projects.  On the one hand, very few users, with the prospect of commercialization, much less commercial success seeming remote.  On the other hand, the intellectual challenge is about right for me at this stage of life and it is certainly keeping my aging brain in good shape -- I learned Ruby in 2011 when I got started with this venture and in the last six months have learned Elixir and am starting to learn Erlang.  Elixir and the functional language paradigm it reprsents seem to suit my personal tastes.

Nicole (in New York) and Dylan (here in Columbus, Ohio) are probably up and about as well. I'll get a few things done in the tranquility of the early morning before my doctor's appointment at 8:10.

*Yesterday.* Dylan got his learner's permit for driving.  He is still jet-lagged. Practiced his guitar for 20 minutes before going to bed at 9PM. Beautiful  playing despite the lack of practice -- _Coachman,_ which he is learning, _Blackbird_ and _XX_ from last year.  We both are going to make a big push to practice regularly and a lot in the coming weeks.  Nicole and Dylan had a long conversation at 3AM about their summer plans, love, life, etc.

I've added on piece of digital art to xref::922[Visual Literacy: a Gallery] which I am making for Dylan.

5AM.  Got _benchfella_ working in my LookupNotes project.  A 1600 character, 31 line file of web references is processed by `RenderText` in 1 millisecond. I think that this will be fast enough for my purposes, despite what I hear about Elixirl/Erlang string processing.  And also despite the fact that my implementation of `RenderText.transform` is extremely simple-minded. Should compare with Ruby implementation.

[quote, M. Twain]
--
A stitch in time saves nine.
--


Our aim is to understand the force mediated by the particles associated with a massive free scalar field.  Is it attractive, repulsive, or both?  What is its range?  To do this, let $H_0$ be Hamiltonian for the free scalar field, and consider a perturbation
\[
  J(x) = g_a(x_0)\delta^3(\vec x - \vec a) + g_b(x_0)\delta^3(\vec x - \vec b),
\]
Here $x$ is a four-vector, and we regard $J(x)$ as modeling point sources located at $\vec a$ and $vec b$.  The strength of the sources are defined by the functions $g_a$ and $g_b$. These depend on time.  We imagine that the sources are fully switched on for a time interval of length $\tau$, and that outside this interval, their strength decays to zero.  Thus $\lim_{x_0 \to \pm \infty} g_a(x_0) = 0$, and likewise for $g_b$. We further assume that the switching on and off of the interaction is "slow." This is the index:[adiabatic hypothesis].  Although we do not prove it here, the hypothesis implies that during swtiching, the system remains in its ground-state-of-the-moment.


=== S-matrix

Consider as system as just described.  It fits into the interaction picture with Hamiltonia $H = H_0 + H'$, with interaction Hamiltonian $H'$ given by the scalar function $J(x)$.  The evolution operator $U(t_2,t_1))$  for the interaction picture gives the probability amplitude $\langle b | U(t_2,t_1) | a \rangle$ for a system that is in state $a$ at time $t_1$ to be found in state $b$ at time $t_2$.

In our case, we are interested in the index:[S-matrix] amplitude
\[
  \langle 0 | S | 0 \rangle =_{def} \langle 0 | U(\infty, -\infty) | 0 \rangle \\
  =_{def} \lim_{t \to \infty} \langle 0 | U(t, -t | 0 \rangle
\]
We imagine $-\infty$ to stand for the remote past, where the interaction is turned off, so the behavior of particles is governed by the unperturbed Hamiltonian.  The same considerations apply to the remote future (all of this on the time-scale of a particle life-time).  For a time-independent Hamiltonian, we have
\[
  U(t_2,t_1) = e^{-iH'(t_2-t_1)}
\]
Using $H = H_0 + H'$, we can rewrite this as
\[
U(t_2,t_1) = e^{iH_0t_2} e^{-iH(t_2-t_1)} e^{-iH_0t_1}
\]
In the time dependent case, this reads as
\[
U(t_2,t_1) = e^{iH_0t_2} T e^{-i\int_{t_1}^{t_2}H(t_2-t_1)} e^{-iH_0t_1}
\]
Thus
\[
  \langle 0 | T e^{-i\int_{t_1}^{t_2}H(t_2-t_1)} | 0 \rangle e^{iE_0(t_2 - t_1)},
\]
where $H_0 | 0 \rangle = E_0 | 0 \rangle$.

Now comes a crucial point.  The adiabatic evolution of the system from remote times to time $t_1$ when the interaction is fully switched on evolves the vacuum to the ground state of $H(t_1)$, which has energy $E(g(t_1)) = E_J$.  Thus, to a very good approximation,
\[
  \langle 0 | S | 0 \rangle = e^{-(E_J - E_0)\tau} = e^{-\tau\Delta E},
\]
where $\tau$ is the time the interaction is on, and $\Delta E$ is the change in energy from the background state to the end of the interaction.  In the next section, we will compute the $S$-matrix in another way to show that
\[
  \Delta E= -g_1g_2\frac{1}{4\pi} \frac{ e^{-m|\vec x_1 - \vec x_2|}} { | \vec x_1 - \vec x_2 |}
\]
Since the energy is an increasing function of the separation $|\vec x_1 - \vec x_2 |$, the force is an attractive one:  by moving the sources closer, the total energy is decreased. Moreover, since the change in $\Delta E$ is negligible once the separation exceeds a few multiples of $1/m$, the range of the force is roughly $1/m$.

=== Time-ordered exponentials

Computation of the $S$-matrix requires evaluation of the time-ordered exponentail
\[
T\exp \left\{ -i \int d^4x J(x)\hat \phi(x) \right\}
\]
The theorem below reduces its computation to the computation of two factors.  The first factor does not depend on the separation between the sources; we shall ignore it.  The Feynman propagator appears in the second factor;  and we shall use the integral formula for the propagator to evaluate it.

We proceed to the proof of the theorem and will evaluate the time-ordered exponential in the next section.

[env.theorem]
--
\[
T\exp \left\{ -i \int d^4x J(x)\hat \phi(x) \right\}
  =\\ N \left\{ -i \int d^4x J(x)\hat \phi(x) \right\}
 \exp \left\{ - \frac{1}{2} \int d^4x d^4y J(x)
   \langle 0 | T \{ \hat \phi(x) \hat \phi(y) | 0 | \rangle J(y) \right\}
\]
--

*Proof.* The Hamiltonian is
\[
  \hat H(t) = \int d^3x J(x)\hat \phi(t,x)
\]
and the integral on the left in the theorem is
\[
T \left\{ \exp\left( -i \hat H(t) dt \right) \right\}
\sim
e^{-i \hat H(t_n) \Delta t}
e^{-i \hat H(t_{n-1}) \Delta t}
\cdots
e^{-i \hat H(t_1) \Delta t}
\]
For operators $A$ and $B$ which commute with $[A,B]$, we have
\[
  e^Ae^B = e^{A + B + \frac{1}{2}[A,B]},
\]
from which it follows that
\[
T \left\{ \exp\left( -i \hat H(t) dt \right) \right\}
\sim
\exp \left(  -i \Delta t \sum_j\hat H(t_j)
  - \frac{1}{2}  \sum_{k > \ell} [\hat H(t_k), \hat H(t_\ell)]
\right)
\]
Passing to the limit, we find
\[
T\exp \left\{ -i \int d^4x J(x)\hat \phi(x) \right\} =\\
  \exp \left\{ -i \int d^4x J(x)\hat \phi(x) \right\}
  \exp \left\{ -i \frac{1}{2}\int d^4x d^4y J(x)J(y)\theta(x_0 - y_0)[\hat \phi(x), \hat \phi(y) \right\}
\]
To put the right-hand side in better form,
consider first the normal-ordered form of the first factor:
\[
N\left\{
\exp \left\{ -i \int d^4x J(x)\hat \phi(x) \right\}
\right\} =
\exp \left\{ -i \int d^4x J(x)\hat \phi^{(+)}(x) \right\}
\exp \left\{ -i \int d^4x J(x)\hat \phi^{(-)}(x) \right\}
\]
Here $\hat \phi^{(+)}$ is the positive-frequency part of $\hat \phi$, i.e., the part with the annihilation operators;  $\hat \phi^{(-)}$ is the negative-frequency part of $\hat \phi$, i.e., the part with the creation operators.  We can rewrite this as
\[
N\left\{ \cdots \right\} =
 \exp \left\{ -i \int d^4x J(x)\hat \phi(x) \right\}
  \exp \left\{ -i \frac{1}{2}\int d^4x d^4y J(x)J(y))[\hat \phi^{(-)}(x), \hat \phi^{(+)}(y) \right\}
\]
Consequently, we can write
\[
T\left\{ \cdots \right\} =
 N\left\{
\exp \left\{ -i \int d^4x J(x)\hat \phi(x) \right\}
\right\} \times \\
\exp \left\{  \frac{i}{2}\int d^4x d^4y J(x)J(y)
\left([\hat \phi^{(-)}(x), \hat \phi^{(+)}(y)] - \theta(x_0 - y_0)[\hat \phi(x), \hat \phi(y)] \right)
\right\}
\]
The expression in parentheses is a scalar function, and so can be evaluated as a vacuum expectation:
\[
\left( \cdots \right) =
\langle 0 | [\hat \phi^{(-)}(x), \hat \phi^{(+)}(y)] | 0 \rangle
 - \theta(x_0 - y_0)\langle 0 | [\hat \phi(x), \hat \phi(y)] | 0 \rangle \\
\]
The first term on the right-hand side is
\[
\langle 0 | [\hat \phi^{(-)}(x), \hat \phi^{(+)}(y)] | 0 \rangle
 = \langle 0 | \hat \phi^{(-)}(x)\hat \phi^{(+)}(y) - \hat \phi^{(+)}(y)\hat \phi^{(-)}(x)| 0 \rangle \\ = -\langle 0 |  \hat \phi^{(+)}(y)\hat \phi^{(-)}(x)| 0 \rangle =  - \langle 0 | \hat\phi(y) \hat\phi(x) | 0 \rangle
\]
 Therefore
\[
\left( \cdots \right) =
 - \langle 0 | \hat\phi(y) \hat\phi(x)
 - \theta(x_0 - y_0) [\hat \phi(x), \hat \phi(y)] | 0 \rangle
\]
If $x_0 > y_0$, the expression on the right is
\[
 - \langle 0 | \hat\phi(y) \hat\phi(x)
 + [\hat \phi(x), \hat \phi(y)] | 0 \rangle =
 - \langle 0 | \hat \phi(x) \hat \phi(y) | 0 \rangle
\]
If $x_0 < y_0$, the expression on the right is $ - \langle 0 | \hat\phi(y) \hat\phi(x) | 0 \rangle$.  Therefore
\[
   \left( \cdots \right) = - \langle 0 | T\{ \hat\phi(x)\hat\phi(y) \} | 0 \rangle
\]

=== Evaluation of the vacuum expectaton

We must evaluate the vacuum expectation
\[
T\exp \left\{ -i \int d^4x J(x)\hat \phi(x) \right\}
\]
By the theorem, this is a factor times the expression
\[
\langle 0 | \exp \left\{ - \frac{1}{2} \int d^4x d^4y J(x)
   \langle 0 | T \{ \hat \phi(x) \hat \phi(y) | 0 | \rangle J(y) \right\}
| 0 \rangle
\]
Begin by substituting the integral formula for the propagator and formula for $J$.
One obtains a sum of terms, the one of which is
\[
\int d^4 x d^4 y  \frac{d^4 k}{(2\pi)^4} g_a(x_0) g_b(y_0)
  \frac{  \delta^3(\vec x - \vec a)  \delta^3(\vec y - \vec b) e^{ik(x-y) }}
 {k^2 - m^2}
\]
Integrate with respect to $d^3\vec x$ to obtain
\[
\int d x_0 d^4 y  \frac{d^4 k}{(2\pi)^4} k g_a(x_0) g_b(y_0)
  \frac{ \delta^3(\vec y - \vec b) e^{ik_0(x_0-y_0) } e^{i\vec k(\vec a- \vec y) }}
 {k^2 - m^2}
\]
Next, integrate with respect to $\vec y$ to obtain
\[
\int d x_0 dy_0 \frac{d^4 k}{(2\pi)^4} g_a(x_0) g_b(y_0)
  \frac{  e^{ik_0(x_0-y_0) } e^{i\vec k(\vec a- \vec b) }}
 {k^2 - m^2}
\]
The next step is to introduce a new variable $u_0 = x_0  - y_0$ and write the integral as
\[
\int \frac{d u_0}{2\pi} dy_0  \frac{d^3\vec k}{(2\pi)^3}d k_0 g_a(x_0) g_b(y_0)
  \frac{   e^{ik_0u_0 } e^{i\vec k(\vec a- \vec b) }}
 {k^2 - m^2},
\]
Introduce a new variable $u_0 = x_0 - y_0$ and write the preceding expression as
\[
\int \frac{d u_0}{2\pi} dy_0  \frac{d^3\vec k}{(2\pi)^3}d k_0 g_a(u_0 + y_0) g_b(y_0)
  \frac{   e^{ik_0u_0 } e^{i\vec k(\vec a- \vec b) }}
 {k^2 - m^2},
\]
Since $g_a(u_0 + y_0)$ is a slowly varying function of its argument for the interval over which the interaction is switched on, we have
\[
\int \frac{d u_0}{2\pi} dy_0  g_a(u_0 + y_0)   e^{ik_0u_0}
\sim
g_a \delta(k_0),
\]
where we write $g_a$ for the "switched on" value.
Therefore the main integral is approximately
\[
g_a\int dy_0 \frac{ d^3\vec k }{ (2\pi)^3} d k_0\delta(k_0)g_b(y_0)
  \frac{  e^{i\vec k(\vec a- \vec b) }}
 {k^2 - m^2},
\]
Integrate with respect to $y_0$ over to obtain
\[
g_ag_b\tau\int \frac{ d^3\vec k }{ (2\pi)^3}dk_0 \delta(k_0)
  \frac{  e^{i\vec k(\vec a- \vec b) }}
 {k^2 - m^2},
\]
Finally, integrate over $k_0$ and use  $k^2 = k_0^2 - \vec k^2$ to obtain
\[
 - g_ag_b\tau\int \frac{ d^3\vec k }{ (2\pi)^3}
  \frac{  e^{i\vec k(\vec a- \vec b) }}
 {\vec k^2 + m^2},
\]

=== Conclusions

The last integral is one we have seen before in our xref::1010[discussion of the Feynman propagator and the decay of solutions to the static Klein-Gordon equation]. Referring to it, we find that
\[
\Delta E = -\frac{g_ag_b\tau}{4\pi} \frac{e^{-m|\vec a - \vec b|}}{|\vec a - \vec b|}
\]
 This formula is what was claimed earlier. It shows that the force is attractive, and that its range is roughly $1/m$.

*Quantum mechanics* is the physical theory needed to understand atoms, electrons, and other tiny particles.  It answers questions such as these

- Why are atoms stable? According to classical electromagnetic theory, electrons whirling around the nucleus should radiate their energy way in the blink of an eye.

- Why atoms can form molecules.

- Why the spectrum of salt crystals dropped in a flame has bright lines.


To understand quantum mechanics, we need to understand why the classical theories of mechanics and optics cannot explain phenomena such as those listed above.  Despite the fact that they do not work in the quantum domain, they furnish a vocabulary of notions -- force, field, wave, conservation of momentum and energy, symmetry, and minimum principle -- from which one fashions a new language of wave packets and wave functions, operators and observables that form the core of quantum theory and quantum field theory.

We begin with the notion of trajectory in mechanics, then consider optical theories, beginning with Hero of Alexandria (c. AD 30), who explained the law of reflection via a minimum principle for light rays.  Much later came the formulation of Snell's law of refraction and Fermat's explanation of it via a principle of minimum time for rays.  The optical theories motivated physics to find a way of understanding minimum principles.  In 1788, Lagrange formulated his powerful Principle of Least Action. It appears again and again in the history of physics, including its key role in Richard Feynman's path integral approach to quantum field theory.

There is a second branch of the optics storyline.  It begins with Huygens' wave theory of the propagation of light (1670) and gains momentum as it is able to explain not only reflection and refraction, but also phenomena such as interference and diffraction which the ray and corpuscular theories could not.

== Trajectories in classical mechanics

In classical mechanics, which successfully deals with objects such as arrows, baseballs, airplanes, and planets, we are accustomed to the idea of a body moving along a trajectory

[env.equationalign]
--
\bor(t) = (x,y,z)(t)
--
From the trajectory are defined the velocity $\bov(t) = d\bor(t)/dt$ and the acceleration $\boa(t) = d\bov(t)/dt$.  And once these are given, we have Newton's second law, $\boF = m\boa$, where a force $\boF$ is applied to a body of mass $m$. To set the stage for later developments, recall that the _momentum_ of a body is $\bop = m\bov$, so that Newton's law can be written
[env.equation#newton2nd]
--
\frac{d\bop}{dt} = \boF
--
The rate of change of the "quantity of motion" is equal to the applied force.  Such is the basis of classical mechanics as bequeathed to us by Isaac Newton in his _PhilosophiÃ¦ Naturalis Principia Mathematica_ (1687)


== Uncertainty principle

image::84[width=200, float=right]

Alas, the notion of trajectory does not hold in quantum mechanics.  This is because of the uncertainty principle, which has to do with the fact that a particle such as an electron does not have a position in the classical sense, but rather is a fuzzy object whose extent is measured by a quantity $\Delta x$. That is, we cannot say exactly where the electron is, but rather can say that it has a certain probability distribution of possible locations, as in the figure, with most of the probability concentrated in a region of width $\Delta x$.  Later, when we have the language of wave packets and wave functions,  we will be able to give a better explanation.  The same considerations apply to the momentum, so we also have a quantity $\Delta p$ which measures its "uncertainty."  The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle asserts that the product of these quantities has a lower bound:

[env.equation#uncertainty_principle]
--
  \Delta x \, \Delta p \ge \frac{\hbar}{2}
--
Here $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant $h/2\pi$.
Planck's constant itself is
[env.equation#planck_constant]
--
h = 6.6\times 10^{-34}\;\text{Joule-sec}
--
It has the dimension of an _action_ and is the fundamental constant of quantum physics.

One sometimes says that $\Delta x$ is the standard deviation in measurements of position of (say) a particle, and that $\Delta p$ is the same for the momentum.  There is an element of truth to this if one thinks of a series of repeated experiments.  But the real truth lies deeper.  It has to do with the fuzziness mentioned above, and can only be properly stated in the language of wave packets.

You may say, OK, all that philosophy is fine, but let's rig thing so that $\Delta x$ is so small that we might as well consider out particle to be a classical point particle.  But if $\Delta x$ is very, very small, then the uncertainty principle ensures that $\Delta p$ will be very, very large, as will be $\Delta v = \Delta p/m$.  In our attempt to recover a classical trajectory, we make $\Delta p$ so large that the notion of a well defined velocity is meaningless. Thus, whatever the mathematical language of quantum mechanics is, it cannot be based on a function $\bor(t)$ which gives position and therefore also velocity $\bov(t)$ and momentum $\bop(t)$.

=== Thought experiment: electron in a small box


Let's make a back of the envelope calculations for a little thought experiment on electrons.

We will confine an electron to a little box with the dimension of two Bohr radiii.  The Bohr radius, which has a value of $5.3\times 10^{-11}\; m$, is the theoretical radius of the hydrogen atom in Niels Bohr's successful first quantum theory.  Thus our box is roughly the size of an atom, with a dimension of $10^{-11}\; m$ or one Angstrom.  The uncertainty principle tells us that if $\Delta x$ is less than one Angstrom, then $\Delta p$ is at least $5.9\times 10^{-35}\; \text{kg-m/sec}$. We use this to compute the uncertainty in the kinetic energy using the relation
[env.equation]
--
  K.E. = \frac{1}{2}\;mv^2 = \frac{p^2}{2m}
--
Thus $\Delta E = (\Delta p)^2/m = 1.6\times 10^{-19}\; \text{Joules}$.

To understand the significance of the value just computed for $\Delta E$, we compare it to the energy of the rest mass of an electron:
[env.equation#emc2]
--
E = mc^2
--
An electron has rest mass
[env.equation#m_e]
--
m_e = 9.1\times 10^{-31}\;\text{kg}
--
Using  $c = 3\times 10^8\;\text{m/sec}$ for the velocity of light, we find $E_{rest} = 8.2\times 10^{-14}\; \text{Joules}$.  Thus $\Delta E$ is small compared to $E_{rest}$.

What about the velocity?  If we make a straightforward classical computation, we find $\Delta v = (\Delta p)/m = 6000\;\text{m/s}$.  The electron  "can be moving pretty fast" and so does not have a very well localized momentum

=== A smaller box

Let us continue the thought experiment. This time, we will confine the electron to a box about the size of a proton, so that $\Delta x = 10^{-15}\;\text{m}$.  Repeating the calculations, we find that $\Delta p = 2.5\times 10^{-20}\;\text{kg-m/s}$ and $\Delta E = 7\times 10^{-10}\;\text{Joules}$.  This time $\Delta E$ is much, much larger than the rest mass. It is so large that some of that energy could be converted into the formation of new particles!  This is the phenomenon of _pair production_.  It actually happens, indeed, is happening all around us.

=== Relativistic computations

The large value for the uncertainty of the momentum implies a large value for the uncertainty in the velocity: $\Delta v = (\Delta p)/m = 2.7\times 10^{10}\;\text{m/s}$.  This is much higher than the velocity of light and so our previous computation cannot be correct.  For a correct computation, we use the energy-moment relation of special relativity:
[env.equation#energy_momentum_relation]
--
 E^2 = (pc)^2 + ( mc^2 )^2
--
We will explain this later when when we review special relativity.  But for now, observe that the factors of $c$ and $c^2$ in the parentheses ensure that all terms on the right have the same dimension, namely energy.  Doing the computation, we find that
[env.equation]
--
(\Delta E)^2 = 5.6\times 10^{-23} + 6.7\times 10^{-27}
--
Thus $\Delta E \sim 7.5\times 10^{-12}$.  This value is about 100 times less than the one previously calculated, but is still about 100 times greater than the rest mass.  There is still enough energy for pair production.

=== Creation and annihllation
Pair production is the domain of quantum field theory, which has built into the notion of fields of creation and annihilation operators $\hat a^\dagger$ and $\hat a$.  We will, however, take things step by step, first studying these operators in the simplest possible context, that of a quantum-mechanical harmonic oscillator.  Next we will consider discrete but possibly infinite systems of oscillators, and lastly fields thereof.  In a certain sense, the universe is a vast collection of harmonic oscillators!
